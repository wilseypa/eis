Realtime Transfer Function Estimation in Electrochemical Impedence Spectroscopy System using an FPGA 

Author: Benjamin Jones

Description: 

Electrochemical Impedence Spectroscopy is fundamentally the process of estimating the transfer function-- 
the frequency-dependent impedence characterisitcs of an electrochemical system. EIS can help identify 
irregularities in biological systems such as brain injuries. This project extends the work of an EIS system 
from data gathering and post-processing, to online realtime analysis. This is accomplished with the use 
of a multi-channel 24-bit ADC combined with an FPGA performing the digital signal processing. An analysis 
of the electrical characteristics, computational performance, and detection capabilities of the system are 
performed.
