==DC Rejection==
Author: Benjamin Jones
Description: EIS signals from experimental setup have long time-constant drifting DC signals which need to be rejected
in order to decrease the needed bit-rate for an ADC (analog digital converter). This project aims to find solutions 
which do not require large passive reactance, and are lower cost relative to thecurrent 24-bit National Instruments DAQ.
